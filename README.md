# Special Instructions: 
I added some code at the end of my program to accomidate for closing all opened windows created by my program. Instructions are given in the terminal and it's pretty self-explanatory from there, just wanted to write a quick note about it here in case you were  focused on the opened windows / didn't see the prompts from the terminal.
